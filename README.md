## Overview

This application combines web scraping, vector embeddings, and conversational AI to create an intelligent job search experience. It automatically extracts job postings from LinkedIn, processes them through embeddings, and provides natural language search capabilities with contextual answers.

### Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Natural language queries that understand intent, not just keywords
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Contextual answers with job recommendations and insights
- **Advanced Filtering**: Role-based and location-based filtering for precise results
- **Intelligent Ranking**: MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) reranking for diverse, relevant results
- **Export Functionality**: Download search results as CSV for further analysis
- **Fresh Data**: Daily refresh scripts to pull the latest postings

---

## Usage

1. **Open the site [https://www.truenorthjobsai.ca/](https://www.truenorthjobsai.ca/)**

2. **Enter your query in the text box for example ‚Äúdata scientist Toronto with PySpark‚Äù or ‚Äúentry level machine learning engineer Vancouver**

3. **Pick filters such as Role or Location then click Search**

4. **Wait for results, review the answer with sources and use the Apply link or download sources as CSV**

## Architecture

### Data Pipeline
1. **Web Scraping** (`extract_jobs_data_01.py`): Automated LinkedIn job extraction via BrightData API
2. **Data Storage** (`load_data_02.py`): PostgreSQL database for storing structured job data
3. **Vector Indexing** (`create_index_03.py`): Pinecone vector database setup
4. **Embedding Pipeline** (`ingest_data_to_pinecone_04.py`): Text processing and creating vector embeddings in Pinecone
5. **Search Interface** (`app_05.py`): Streamlit-powered web application

---

### Technology Stack

**Backend Infrastructure**
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Pinecone for vector similarity search
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for response generation
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for semantic embeddings

**Data Processing**
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- tiktoken for token management
- NumPy for mathematical operations
- psycopg2 for PostgreSQL connectivity

**Frontend**
- Streamlit for interactive web interface
- Real-time search with caching optimization
- Responsive design with filtering capabilities
