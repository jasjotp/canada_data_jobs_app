NOTE: This is a full-time, permanent, hybrid position in downtown Vancouver, with 3 set days in the office and 2 WFH. Job Overview: As a Machine Learning Engineer II, you independently design, build, and maintain machine learning systems that deliver impact for our customers and business. You are responsible for deploying reliable, scalable solutions — from credit scoring models to intelligent automation and LLM-powered features. You work across the stack to connect ML systems with real user value. You own end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and transformation to model training, validation, and online inference. You actively contribute to model quality, observability, and performance optimization. You also help standardize development practices, CI/CD, and deployment tooling for ML systems. You are expected to integrate modern AI techniques — including LLM APIs, embeddings, and generative workflows — where appropriate, and help evaluate how they can enhance products and operations. You use AI development tools to accelerate delivery and improve testing and debugging. You also build and maintain automated data pipelines and model services, working across real-time and batch systems.
